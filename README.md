# Family tree
> It's a prototype and can be extended to full project (may be in future)

### Feature
1. Can add family member in the tree
2. All the data is saved in the browser (using "local storage")

### Current thinking (what basic feature its lack and can be added in near future)
1. Deleting the member from tree
2. Adding independent member (not linked with any member)
3. Logic to find the relation ship between the two member (by using graph algorithm)

## How to run project locally
```javascript
npm install //installs the dependencies (only required for the 1st time running the app)
```
```javascript
npm start //runs the app locally at port 3000
```
